### What I learned during this project:
Read history for a better background, but this time around the hardest part to figure out was the grid layout of each pixel, and how to make it organize itself based on how many pixels are selected. Looking back now the answer was extremely simple, just edit grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns each time the size of the board is changed. That being said, I still was able to get this all done in one night, which was extremely exciting for me.

### A little history behind this project
When I first started learning web development, specifically DOM manipulation with JavaScript, I had a lot of trouble with this particular project and the logic behind it. It probably took me two full weeks after work and full weekends of trying to wrap my brain around this concept. After two weeks, I had a functional app with all the requirements met.

Fast forward about a year or more, I decided I definitely wanted to make web development my career. I signed myself up for community college and really started studying at every oppurtunity. On May 11th, I decided I wanted to create this very project, and without looking at my old code, I was able to build the main application with all the functionality and logic in a single night after work, as opposed to taking two weeks before. Seeing that progress was really exciting.
